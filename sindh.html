    <p>Sindh is a province of
        Pakistan. Located in the southeastern region of the country, Sindh is the third-largest province of Pakistan by
        land area and the second-largest province by population after Punjab. It is bordered by the Pakistani provinces
        of Balochistan to the west and north-west and Punjab to the north. It shares an International border with the
        Indian states of Gujarat and Rajasthan to the east; it is also bounded by the Arabian Sea to the south. Sindh's
        landscape consists mostly of alluvial plains flanking the Indus River, the Thar Desert in the eastern portion of
        the province along the international border with India, and the Kirthar Mountains in the western portion of the
        province.</p>
