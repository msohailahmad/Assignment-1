    <p>Punjab is a province of Pakistan. Located in
        central-eastern region of the country, Punjab is the second-largest province of Pakistan by land area and the
        largest province by population. It is bordered by the Pakistani provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the
        north-west, Balochistan to the south-west and Sindh to the south, as well as Islamabad Capital Territory to the
        north-west and Autonomous state of AJK to the north. It shares an International border with the Indian states of
        Rajasthan and Punjab to the east and Indian-administered Kashmir to the north-east. Punjab is the most fertile
        province of the country as River Indus and its four major tributaries Ravi, Jhelum, Chenab and Sutlej flow
        through it.<br>

        The province forms the bulk of the transnational Punjab region, now divided among Pakistan and India. The
        provincial capital is Lahore â€” a cultural, modern, historical, economic, and cosmopolitan centre of Pakistan.
        Other major cities include Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, and Multan- the historic capital of the
        region. Punjab is also the world's fifth-most populous subnational entity, and the most populous outside of
        China and India.</p>
