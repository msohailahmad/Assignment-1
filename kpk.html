    <p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa commonly
        abbreviated as KP or KPK, is a province of Pakistan. Located in the northwestern region of the country, Khyber
        Pakhtunkhwa is the smallest province of Pakistan by land area and the third-largest province by population. It
        is bordered by the Pakistani provinces of Balochistan to the south, Punjab to the south-east, the territory of
        Gilgit-Baltistan to the north and north-east, Islamabad Capital Territory to the east and Azad Kashmir to the
        north-east. It shares an international border with Afghanistan to the west. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has a varied
        landscape ranging from rugged mountain ranges, valleys, plains surrounded by hills, undulating submontane areas
        and dense agricultural farms.<br>

        While it is the third-largest Pakistani province in terms of both its population and its economy, it is
        geographically the smallest.[3] The province is home to 17.9 percent of Pakistan's total population, with the
        majority of its inhabitants being Pashtuns.<br>

        Once a stronghold of Buddhism, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the site of the ancient region of Gandhara, including the
        ruins of the Gandharan capital of Pushkalavati (located near modern-day Charsadda). The region's history is
        characterized by frequent invasions by various empires, largely due to its geographical proximity to the
        historically important Khyber Pass.<br>

        Although it is colloquially known by a variety of other names, the name "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa" was brought into
        effect for the North-West Frontier Province in April 2010, following the passing of the 18th Constitutional
        Amendment. On 2 March 2017, the Pakistani government considered a proposal for a merger of the adjoining
        Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as well as a repealing of the Frontier Crimes
        Regulation, which Pakistan had inherited following the partition of British India in 1947.[5] However, some
        political parties opposed the merger, and instead called for the FATA to be reorganized as a separate
        province.[6] However, on 24 May 2018, the National Assembly of Pakistan voted in favour of the 25th
        Constitutional Amendment, which would merge the FATA as well as the Provincially Administered Tribal Areas with
        Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.[7] The Provincial Assembly of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa subsequently approved the bill on 28 May
        2018;[8] it was signed into law on 31 May by erstwhile Pakistani president Mamnoon Hussain, which officially
        completed the administrative merger process</p>
