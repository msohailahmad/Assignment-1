    <p>Balochistan is a province of
        Pakistan. Located in the southwestern region of the country, Balochistan is the largest province of Pakistan by
        land area but is the least populated one. It is bordered by the Pakistani provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the
        north-east and Punjab to the east and Sindh to the south-east. It shares international borders with Iran to the
        west and Afghanistan to the north; It is also bound by the Arabian Sea to the south. Balochistan is an extensive
        plateau of rough terrain divided into basins by ranges of sufficient heights and ruggedness. It has the world's
        largest deep sea port, The Port of Gwadar lying in the Arabian Sea.<br>

        Although it makes up about 44% of the land area of Pakistan, only 5% of it is arable and is noted for an
        extremely dry desert climate.[6][7] Despite this, agriculture and livestock makes up about 47% of Balochistan's
        economy. [8]<br>

        The name "Balochistan" means "the land of the Baloch". Largely underdeveloped, its provincial economy is also
        dominated by natural resources, especially its natural gas fields. Aside from Quetta, the second-largest city of
        the province is Turbat in the south, while another area of major economic importance is port city of Gwadar on
        the Arabian Sea, an emerging future business hub</p>
